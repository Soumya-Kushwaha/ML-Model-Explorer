# ML-Model-Master

## Overview

ML Model Master is an interactive Streamlit web application that empowers you to explore various machine learning classifiers and optimize their hyperparameters. Experiment with popular datasets and classifiers to understand their impact on classification tasks.

## Features

- **Dataset Exploration:** Choose from popular datasets like Iris, Breast Cancer, and Wine Dataset.
- **Classifier Variety:** Experiment with a diverse range of supervised learning classifiers, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, and Naive Bayes.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Fine-tune hyperparameters specific to each classifier through user-friendly sliders, allowing you to visualize their influence on model performance.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation:** Gain insights into model performance with a comprehensive suite of metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and a confusion matrix.
- **Interactive Classification Report:** View a detailed report analyzing class-wise performance.
- **Visual Learning Support (Optional):** For datasets with higher dimensions, the app supports the integration of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to project data into a 2D space for visualization, aiding in understanding data distribution (requires enabling this functionality in the code).

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:** Use ```git clone https://github.com/your-username/ML-Model-Master.git``` to download the code.
2. **Install Dependencies:** Navigate to the project directory and run ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` to install essential libraries (Streamlit, scikit-learn, seaborn, and others).
3. **Run the App:** Execute ```streamlit run main.py``` (or the appropriate command for your Streamlit setup) to launch the application in your web browser.

## Deployment

(This section will be added in the future when the application is deployed.)
