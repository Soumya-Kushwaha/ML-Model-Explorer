# ML Model Explorer

## Overview

ML Model Explorer is an interactive Streamlit web application that empowers you to explore various machine learning classifiers and optimize their hyperparameters. Experiment with popular datasets and classifiers to understand their impact on classification tasks.

Try it out live at [ml-model-explorer.streamlit.app](https://ml-model-explorer.streamlit.app).

## Features

- **Dataset Exploration:** Choose from popular datasets like Iris, Breast Cancer, and Wine.
- **Classifier Variety:** Experiment with a diverse range of classifiers, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, and Naive Bayes.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Adjust hyperparameters specific to each classifier through user-friendly sliders to see how they impact model performance.
- **Performance Metrics:** Gain insights into model performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores.
- **Confusion Matrix:** Visualize classification performance through a confusion matrix.
- **Classification Report:** View detailed reports analyzing class-wise performance.
- **ROC Curve:** For binary classification tasks, visualize the ROC curve and the area under the curve (AUC).
